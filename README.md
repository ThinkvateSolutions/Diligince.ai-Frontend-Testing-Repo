  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    // Verify user permissions against required permissions
    // Handle company-level and resource-level access control
  };
};

// Resource ownership validation
const validateOwnership = (resourceType: string) => {
  return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    // Verify user has access to specific resource
  };
};
```

### ISO 9001 Compliance Backend

#### Audit Trail System
```typescript
interface AuditEntry {
  _id: ObjectId;
  entityType: 'requirement' | 'purchase_order' | 'document' | 'user';
  entityId: ObjectId;
  action: string;
  userId: ObjectId;
  timestamp: Date;
  changes: ChangeRecord[];
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  complianceRelevant: boolean;
}

// Automatic audit logging middleware
const auditLogger = (entityType: string) => {
  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    // Log all CRUD operations with full context
  };
};
```

#### Document Control
```typescript
interface DocumentVersion {
  version: string;
  content: Buffer;
  checksum: string;
  approvedBy: ObjectId[];
  approvalDate: Date;
  changes: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}

// Document approval workflow
class DocumentApprovalService {
  async submitForApproval(documentId: string, approvers: string[]): Promise<void>;
  async approveDocument(documentId: string, approverId: string): Promise<void>;
  async rejectDocument(documentId: string, approverId: string, reason: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Performance and Scalability

#### Database Optimization
```typescript
// MongoDB Indexes
db.requirements.createIndex({ "status": 1, "createdAt": -1 });
db.requirements.createIndex({ "category": 1, "budget.min": 1, "budget.max": 1 });
db.vendors.createIndex({ "capabilities": 1, "location": "2dsphere" });
db.audit_logs.createIndex({ "timestamp": -1, "entityType": 1 });

// Query optimization strategies
- Aggregation pipelines for complex reporting
- Proper indexing for frequently queried fields
- Connection pooling and query optimization
- Caching strategies for static data
```

#### Caching Strategy
```typescript
// Redis integration for session management and caching
interface CacheStrategy {
  userSessions: RedisStore;
  vendorMatching: TTLCache;
  requirementSearch: QueryCache;
  notificationQueues: RedisQueues;
}
```
