              <p>
                When you create an account with us, you must provide us with accurate, complete, and up-to-date 
                information. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate

              <p>
                You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any

              <p>
                You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon 
                becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

                settings or by contacting our customer support team.

                For any subscription changes or cancellations, changes will take effect at the end of the current 
                billing cycle. You will not receive a refund for the current billing cycle.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use trusted third-party payment processors for all transactions. By providing your payment information,
